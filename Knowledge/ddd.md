### Domain storytelling

Tell a story based on domain. Doesn't require much preparation by the domain expert couse of simple notation (actor, activities, work objects and action numbers). When actor perform multiple actions we don't multiply the actor icon but contract yes.

From story to code:
- work object => class
- activities => methods

Tools:
